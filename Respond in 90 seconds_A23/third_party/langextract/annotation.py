"""Provides functionality for annotating medical text using a language model.

The annotation process involves tokenizing the input text, generating prompts
for the language model, and resolving the language model's output into
structured annotations.

Usage example:
    annotator = Annotator(language_model, prompt_template)
    annotated_documents = annotator.annotate_documents(documents, resolver)
